A recipe app using an API, developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

You get a list of recipes with recipe info on click, 
you can store your favorite recipes,
you can search for a recipe by ingredient and dish name,
and the page reloads when we click on the logo, showing a new random recipe on the first page.
